## Challenges :loudspeaker:

I was not successfull with completing the Employee Tracker Database. Here are the following challenges I faced.

1. Trying to find the right functions for the operations I needed. The addDepartment function is something I just couldn't figure out. I tried a variety of functions from the previous activities and homework assingments but nothing worked

2. Mysql workbench was difficult trying to set up the server to connect with my applicaton 

3. Wasn't able to get any of the other areas working....

4. Being confused, with the material and lacking understanding.
